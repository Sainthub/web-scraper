# web-scraper

 - Hello. My name is Stefan Istoc and this is my first repository
  
  - This is a copied idea taken from the video tutorial made by **Ania Kubow**

- You can find her github [here](https://github.com/kubowania)
   
 - And her YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw)
   I have taken [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3lqUHeZs_0) and I replaced the website to scan

# How to run it
 
 If you want to execute the code in your local machine you will need to run these commands:
 
Type in your console

     npm i 

 


  And then type 
 


     npm run start 




Once you did run these commands:
1.  Open  [http://localhost:8000/results](http://localhost:8000/results)  with your browser to see the results of the scrape in your terminal.
2.  Open the index.html file in your browser to see the results showing up.

Thanks for reading!
